# Basic info (1/2)
- Here's the original [announcement](https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/projekti/topics/create)
- Here's [our proposal](https://github.com/Origami-TinyML/software-engineering-project/blob/main/soft_eng_proj_tinyml_lifecycle.md)
- 5 students are assigned to our project.
- 15 hours / week / student is expected.
- 14 weeks (week 3-16) is scheduled.
  * 15 hours * 14 weeks * 5 students
  * = 1050 hours / 7.5 hour
  * = 140 man days / 22
  * = 6.4 man month.
  - Which unit for SBI workload? (e.g. 3 hours, 7.5 hours or 15 hours)

# Basic info (2/2)
- Milestone 1: MWC is at the end of FEB. on **week 9**.
- Milestone 2: NEXUS Demo day is on 27th March on **week 13**.
- Project duration:
  1. Originally, 14 weeks, Week 3-16
  2. Preferably, 12 weeks, Week 3-14
  3. Ideally, 10 weeks, Week 3-12
- 15 hours * 14 weeks = 210 hours
  1. Originally, 210 hours / 14 weeks = 15 hours/week
  2. Preferably, 210 hours / 12 weeks = 17.5 hours/week
  3. Ideally, 210 hours / 10 weeks = 21 hours/week

UI (Dashboard & Control panel) parts should be prioritized.  

# Project goal (1/2)
We will reproduce [Roberto's demo video](https://youtu.be/xYntGeLmCSI), adding its ML training phase, along with TinyML MCU.
While this demo uses relatively large hardware which may not belong to TinyML strictly (e.g. TinyML should run on RTOS but not on Linux),
we are gradully migrating to TinyML MCUs. There are 4 benefits of starting with the original setting:

1. Jetson nano is a standalone GPU, where we run the following app locally at once before starting pipelining on other nodes.
   - Computer vision app, inc. ML models
   - dashboard on a webserver
   - Jupyter notebook

# Project goal (2/2)
2. We could learn from Jetson nano mature tool-stack what kind of tool-stack is still missing to implement TinyMLaaS.
3. We could start with this existing demo immediately with runnable CI, and
4. We are polishing it more fancy gradually towards TinyML as-a-Service.
4. We could gradually migrating to TinyML by adding or replacing a node one by one.
   - For example, we could replace the data acquistion node with:
     a. Camera sensor + Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense + RPI (for IP)
     b. Camera sensor + RPI pico with WiFi

Our final goal is to run ML on a mirocontrooler node but it's better to start with the safer configuration at first.

# MVP journey
We should always have a runnable MVP automatically generated by CI/CD at every Sprint.

# MVP0

Jetson nano is almost a laptop with GPU so that everything should work standalone.

## ML pipeline
1. Object detection
2. -> face detection
3. -> Person identificaion pipeline

To orchestrate ML, IP connection is convenient so that we insert RPI between Jetson and MCU.

Get rid of Jetson nano but only with TinyMLaaS.

# Kick-off meeting Agenda (1/3)
- Scheduled on 16th JAN (MON)

## Get familiar with all participants. Everyone introduces oneself
  1. What one can do
  2. What one wants to do
  3. How one sees this project

## Will explain [Project goal](#project-goal)
  - We should present [demo video1](https://youtu.be/xYntGeLmCSI) & [demo video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d37narobVG0)

## Set up a SCRUM team (e.g. specify each role in the project)
  - SM: HU instructor + [Michihito Mizutani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michihito/)
  - PO: [Roberto Morabito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertomorabito/)
  - Developer: 5 students
  - ML: [Hiroshi Doyu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hidoyu/)
  - Customer: Perttu & Samuli would review the outcome of increment in bi-weekly meeting.

# Kick-off meeting Agenda (2/3)
## User story mapping
  - Specify PBIs always as GitHub issues, which need to be a PR and it automatically runs CI/CD as acceptance tests.
  - Estimate PBI effort
  - Specify acceptance tests
  - 1 increment == 2 sprint
  - 1st sprint planning should be done on 16th.


# Kick-off meeting Agenda (3/3)
## Agree on WoW in SCRUM
- Use Github project [KANBAN]()
- Use [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kQD685q4) to communicate or Slack?
- Agree on scheduling a Daily meeting day & time
- 1 increment == 2 sprint
- 1st sprint should have some [Architecture investigation](#architecture-investigation) to find out which components are reusable.
- 1st sprint should have a ZFR (Zero Feature Release) to make sure that CI/CD works on Github workflow (action) without any features (or just with existing components)
- We should run CI/CD to reproduce the current Roberto's demo story at first, without a training part. If HW is not available, it could be simulated.


# Architecture investigation @Roberto?
- How should we understand Roberto's demo architecture?
  - Any architecture document?
  - Any architecture block diagram?
  - Any flow diagram?
  - Any list of components used? which could be reused and which not, since the outcome of this project would be opensource'ed.
  - Any list of software frameworks each components uses?
- Should we map each Seamless TinyML lifecycle management's phase on this demo scenario?
- Should we make sure which phases are still missing? (e.g. "2. Model training")

# Mapping 6 Seamless TinyML lifecycle to this project

Phase # | Name | Early phase | Demo
:---:|:---|:---|:---
1| Data collection | Simulated | RPI pico + Cam 
2| Model training | Missing | On Cloud VM?
3| Model squeezing | ML compiler | ML compiler 
4| Model splitting | Standalone |  Pipelining
5| Model deployment | Standalone | TBI
6| Model update | Dashboard | Control panel



# Remaining questions
- What's the main purpose of this project from students' perspective? (e.g. experience Agile development)
- How long can the 16th meeting be allocated? (e.g. 3-4 hours with lunch break)
- What kind of competency are students generally expected? (e.g. Python, JS, Java, Frontend, Embedded)
- Can student's weekly working hours be negotiable? (e.g. 15 hours with 14 weeks -> 17.5 hours with 12 weeks)
